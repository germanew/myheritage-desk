    <p>
      Genealogy has come of age—and MyHeritage is at the forefront of this revolution. With millions of users worldwide, its immersive DNA tests, powerful historical record collections, and intuitive family tree builder help people reconnect with their past in profound ways. </p>

    <p>This guide is your roadmap to ensuring every query is answered, every issue resolved, and every stage of your heritage journey runs smoothly.</p>
    <a name="when-to-reach-out"></a>
    <h3>2. When to Reach Out to MyHeritage Customer Service</h3>
    <p>Understanding when to escalate an issue to customer service saves time and streamlines your user experience. Here are common triggers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account Access Issues : Forgotten password, login errors, account locked, or two‑factor authentication issues.</li>
      <li>Subscription Management : Billing disputes, upgrade/downgrade requests, adding multiple family members to plans.</li>
      <li>DNA Kit Questions : Ordering kits, hidden results, delays in processing, interpreting raw data, or replacement kit needs.</li>
      <li>Research & Family Tree Help : Merging duplicates, fixing relationships, resolving hints, privacy settings, record searches.</li>

    <h3>3. Preparing Before You Call</h3>
    <p>
     To ensure effective communication:.
    </p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>Gather personal info:</b> Email address, account username, order reference for DNA kits or subscription ID.</li>
      <li><b>List key dates:</b>  When did the issue first occur, key timestamps, error messages, or steps you’ve already taken.</li>
      <li><b>Estimate your window/time preferences:</b> Morning, midday, or evening helpdesk availability.</li>
      <li><b>Prepare screenshots:</b> Error dialogs, login attempts, billing statements—if emailing or uploading is possible.</li>

      <p>Once connected, be ready with your account email, subscription plan, DNA kit number (if applicable), or order details. Having these ready will help the representative locate your records and accelerate the resolution.</p>
